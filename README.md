# Encryption-and-Decryption-of-different-file-formats-using-symmetric-and-asymmetric-algorithms

Project Overview

This project focuses on securing files using cryptographic techniques. It implements both symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms to protect data from unauthorized access.

🎯 Objectives

To understand file security concepts

To implement encryption and decryption techniques

To compare symmetric and asymmetric algorithms

To securely handle different file formats

Algorithms Used

Symmetric Algorithms

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

Asymmetric Algorithms

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

📁 Supported File Formats

Text files (.txt)

Image files (.jpg, .png)

Document files (.pdf, .docx)

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Cryptography libraries


🛠 How It Works

User selects a file

Chooses encryption type (symmetric or asymmetric)

File is encrypted and stored securely

Decryption restores the original file

🚀 Features
